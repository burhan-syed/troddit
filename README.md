The redirect uri should match the REDDIT_REDIRECT variable.

## Docker

### To Deploy the [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bsyed/troddit)

```sh
docker pull bsyed/troddit
docker run -d --name troddit -p 3000:3000 bsyed/troddit
```

### To Build the Image Yourself

By default, the Docker will expose port 3000, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

Clone and navigate to the repository 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/burhan-syed/troddit
cd troddit
```

To build the image and run container

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Or to just build

```sh
docker build . -t troddit
```

This will create the troddit image and pull in the necessary dependencies. To run:

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 troddit
```
